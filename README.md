What is the Darvas Box Theory?<br>
Darvas box theory is a trading strategy developed by Nicolas Darvas to target stocks using highs and volume as key indicators. Darvas developed his theory in the 1950s while travelling the world as a professional ballroom dancer. Darvas' trading technique involves buying into stocks that are trading at new highs and drawing a box around the recent highs and lows to establish entry point and placement of the stop-loss order. A stock is considered to be in a Darvas box when the price action rises above the previous high but falls back to a price not far from that high.
